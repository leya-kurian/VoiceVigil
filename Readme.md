## Overview

With the increasing use of artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques, deepfake audio has become a significant concern, especially in fields like media, politics, and cybersecurity. This project addresses the challenge of detecting such manipulated audio files, providing a robust solution using machine learning.

## Features

- **Deepfake Audio Detection:** Uses a CNN model trained on a dataset of real and fake audio samples to classify new audio inputs.
- **User-friendly Interface:** The frontend is designed with HTML and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and clean user experience.
- **Flask Backend:** The backend is developed using Flask, enabling efficient processing and integration with the machine learning model.

## Usage

1. Upload an audio file to check whether it is real or fake.
2. The result will be displayed on the web page.

## Importance and Advantages

### Importance

- **Security:** Detecting deepfake audio is crucial in maintaining the integrity of information, particularly in areas like media, law enforcement, and political campaigns.
- **Trust:** By providing tools to identify fake audio, we can help restore trust in digital communications.

### Advantages

- **High Accuracy:** The CNN model is trained on a carefully curated dataset, ensuring high accuracy in detecting fake audio.
- **Scalable:** The project can be easily scaled with more data and additional features, such as real-time detection.
- **User-Friendly:** The web interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing users of any technical background to use the tool effectively.
